    <strong>Hello World</strong>
    <em>Hello World</em>
    <p style="color: red;">
        Greeting My name is Anshika Gupta. I am 21 years old fresher but diligent girl and i am from Kanpur uttarpradesh. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in AI & ML from Allenhouse Institute of Technology, AKTU, with a CGPA of 8.7.

Recently, I interned at Infosys Springboard’s, where I worked as AI Intern under IT foundation in which I gain a knowledge about  AI-based automation and business solutions in a hybrid setup. While the internship is theoretical based but i implement that golden information in real world problem and solve the solution practically.

I’ve always been passionate about building solutions with purpose. One of my ongoing project is QR LifeKey, a health-tech platform that uses AI and stealth QR wallpapers to display emergency medical details instantly — built with reactjs and tailwind css and for backend i use node js and mongo db for databases , rather than frontend and backend , also use AI tools for integration and faster response. I also built Apda Mitra, a disaster response system using satellite image segmentation with drones and Python. Additionally, I developed a Spring Boot + React Contact Manager . aprat from this i also work on ai sdr and ai marketing agent type project in which i learn about ai tools and integration .
